  "bio": [
    "I'm a Computer Science graduate from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET), currently based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. My journey in tech started with a curiosity about how things work, which evolved into a passion for building solutions that solve real-world problems.",
    "I specialize in full-stack web development and mobile app development, with hands-on experience in Django, React, Flutter, and various backend technologies including PostgreSQL and Docker. I enjoy the entire process of bringing ideas to life—from initial concept and architecture to deployment and optimization.",
    "Beyond development, I'm an avid competitive programmer with 200+ problems solved across platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, and AtCoder. This practice has sharpened my algorithmic thinking and ability to write efficient, optimized code.",
    "When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, reading about system design, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in continuous learning and staying curious about emerging trends in software development."
